# Mean And Mode Calculator Microservice

Description of program:

This program operates individually and while running it will periodically read a text file in the directory, 
titled "data.txt" and it will read it for usable data such as numbers or decimal values. The program will then 
use that data to calculate the mean and mode(s) of the data. Then, it will write the results on the first two 
lines of another text file called "results.txt" for the user of the microservice to read and use how they desire.
